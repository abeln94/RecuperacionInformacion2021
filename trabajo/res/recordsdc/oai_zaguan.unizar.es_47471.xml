    <dc:description>Nowadays, holistic education is finding its way into some educational institutions but, what about the implementation in schools? This study is an educational intervention that takes multiple intelligences as an overarching element in the English Primary classroom through a holistic approach based on storytelling. For this purpose, the present dissertation examines the role played by holistic education nowadays as well as the extent to which the new educational law, LOMCE, encourages teachers to incorporate new methodologies in their classrooms. Being aware of the limits, a multiple intelligences-based Unit of work has been elaborated and actually implemented in a First Grade Primary classroom leading to some interesting conclusions.</dc:description>
