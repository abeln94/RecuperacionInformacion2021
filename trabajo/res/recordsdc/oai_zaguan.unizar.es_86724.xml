    <dc:description>Communicative competence has been stated by the LOMCE curriculum as one of the preeminent aspects of secondary education. Akbari and Razavi (2015) have asserted that since the mid-1970s Communicative Language Teaching (CLT) has been considered essential to promote the students’ competences for the real world. This implication has been the basis to apply a CLT approach so as to develop the aforementioned aspect. Taking this into account, the present “Trabajo de Fin de Master” aims at developing a learning unit for EFL classroom in secondary education. During the practicum period, I observed that the students presented lack of motivation towards the target language, and, therefore, this learning unit intends to meet this need. With this purpose, a Project- Based Learning methodology will be proposed, in which they will finally be asked to carry out their own newspaper as a final outcome of the project. With the purpose of developing this learning unit, the students will be working with authentic materials extracted from the media. Many authors have elaborated on the benefits that working with real materials have. Melvin and Stout (1987), (cited in Oura, [2001]) found that students were more interested in the language when the materials proposed were authentic and they also perceived an increment in the students’ motivation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</dc:description>
