    <dc:description>Theatre has been used in education since middle ages and this has been reflected in the successive educational laws. However, global society has brought about two requirements to our schools: learning a second language and the development of cultural and social awareness. Social Theatre seems to give an answer to both needs, being not just a tool for real communication in the bilingual classroom but a way to achieve the required holistic and comprehensive child development, considering always a ludic approach. That is why this study would like to demonstrate the potential of socio-bilingual drama techniques in the infant education classroom, focusing on the adaptation of Listening Theatre (Mato, 2006), Poor Theatre (Grotowski, 1970) and Theatre of the Oppressed (Boal, 1992) techniques in the CLIL context.</dc:description>
