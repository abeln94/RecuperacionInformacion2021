    <dc:description>At the beginning of the twentieth century,  James M. Barrie's play Peter Pan, or the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up (1904) became so famous that Barrie turned it into a novel that has become one of the best world-known classics of  children literature. However, in the twenty first century, Peter Pan's story is best known for its literary and filmic adaptations than for the original novel and little is known about the real characterisation that Barrie gave his characters. This essay deals with the novel Peter Pan (1911) in order to analyse the treatment given to female characters and their roles in the story. To achieve it, the kind of criticism traditionally applied to “Major Literature” will also be applied to this children's book that, even though considered “minor literature”, shares similar ideological characteristics with greater works of literature.</dc:description>
