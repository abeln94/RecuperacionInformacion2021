    <dc:description>This dissertation is addressed towards the analysis of the fairy tale as an instrument to teach English as a foreign language in the Infant Education stage, considering its cultural and extracurricular component. It aims to understand the employment of fairy tales and the array of advantages they offer. In order to reach our goal, this document provides with a theoretical overview of this concept through the revision of literature on this topic and the current legislative framework. Simultaneously, we have complemented our investigation by means of a survey based on the qualitative method. This survey was filled in by thirty teachers in order to illustrate the real significance of fairy tales in the English classroom. Once analyzed, we will observe the results and establish some conclusions about whether the knowledge acquired about fairy tales through the evidences exposed in this dissertation meets the real practice of English teachers.</dc:description>
