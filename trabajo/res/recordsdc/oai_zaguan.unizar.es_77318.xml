    <dc:description>During my placement period in a private with public funding school in Zaragoza, I attended 4th year E.S.O lessons. There, I could detect something that I had been observing before, not only in schools, but in our society in general: social-emotional intelligence is not very often taken into account or given the importance that it deserves. Therefore I decided to design a learning unit for the English-as-a-Foreign-Language classroom that gave importance to emotions and that enabled students to exploit their communicative competence in order to express their emotions accordingly. In order to achieve these objectives, communicative language teaching and cooperative principles have been followed and the guidelines provided by the LOMCE Aragonese Curriculum for Educación Secundaria Obligatoria (E.S.O) (2016) have been taken into account for the design of my teaching unit. The design is based on several principles connecting the importance of communication and cooperative techniques as essential elements in the awareness and proper development of communicative competence. I have also fostered student motivation, considering it as a key aspect for both the emotional aspects and enhancement of encouragement of the students towards the lessons.</dc:description>
