    <dc:description>Fluorescence microscopy is a very useful tool for biological research as it allows selective molecule labeling and life-cell imaging. In the last decades, the development of super resolution microscopy techniques has enabled us to gain a deeper insight into different biological processes. In any kind of fluorescence microscopy, correct molecule labeling is key to obtaining good quality images. In this project, two fusion proteins were designed to fluorescently label different cellular structures and show the potential of a super resolution microscopy technique known as SIM (Structured Illumination Microscopy). First protein targeted was ZO1 (zonula occludens 1), which is located at epithelial cells tight junctions and has been reported to be important for Neisseria gonorrhoeae (N. gonorroheae) infection [1]. The goal was to fluorescently label ZO1 at its N-terminal domain, so it could be used in later studies about N. gonorrhoeae infection mechanism. The objective was to clone ZO1 at the C-terminal end of the fluorescent proteins mCherry and GFP, but ZO1 big size made amplification difficult and not enough amplified product was obtained to successfully transform Escherichia coli (E.coli) and clone it. The other protein labelled was F1ß, which forms part of the ATPase complex located at the inner mitochondrial membrane [2]. F1ß was fluorescently labelled at its C-terminal end with GFP and mCherry. Confocal fluorescent microscope images of the transfected HeLa cells demonstrated the correct colocalization of our protein with immunofluorescently labelled Tom20 and Peroxiredoxin 3 (Prx3). Mitochondria images taken with the SIM microscope showed the submitochondrial structure, distinguishing between outer mitochondrial membrane and inner membrane. These transfected cells can be used in later studies about submitochondrial protein localization.&lt;br /&gt;</dc:description>
