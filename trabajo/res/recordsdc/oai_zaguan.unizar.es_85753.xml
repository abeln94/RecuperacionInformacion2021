    <dc:description>The goal of this project was analysing if a restaurant based on experiential dinning would succeed in the city of Zaragoza. Having this objective in mind it was necessary to develop a market research.  There were two basic ideas proposed, one for the long-run experience (Dynamism) and the other one for the short-run (Playing while eating). In order to cover the need of opinions and direct information, a focus group was made. The results form this technique made us split the research in two parts, one for each topic. At the end, we decided to follow the Playing while eating topic as there were more information available. After that decision, in order to go in depth with the topic we developed another focus group fully oriented to the playing topic.  From that focus group we gathered a lot of useful information that had to be checked and compared using a representative sample, which made us develop a survey.  Thanks to this survey we could analyse the data in a mathematical way (using averages and percentages) that allowed us to develop the final conclusions of the research and guided us to think about some recommendations for a future. The general conclusion of the research is that depending of the initial investment and the will to organize (as it would be complex) this project would succeed or not (following some of the recommendations of the project).&lt;br /&gt;</dc:description>
