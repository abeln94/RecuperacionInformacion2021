    <dc:description>For a large part of their history, video games have portrayed female characters in an unrealistic way, mainly regarding their personality traits, physical appearance and the presence women have in video games. This problem has persisted in many mainstream games, and hence it is something to be analyzed and addressed. Therefore, it is important to acknowledge those games that achieve to represent women realistically. This dissertation explores the portrayal of female characters in video games by focusing on the main character from the video game Beyond: Two Souls. The analysis provides a preliminary basis of the issues female characters have faced in mainstream video games, and then focuses on narrative aspects of the game as well as it provides insight into the use of realism as a form of social critique. The analysis concludes that the game manages to portray its main character in a realistic and relatable way, and hence the game becomes an example of positive female representations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</dc:description>
