    <dc:description>Over the last few years, the role of journalistic translation as an instrument to mediate between different cultures and societies from all over the world has grown considerably due to the constant development of new communication channels that contribute to the dissemination of information.  Consequently, there is a need to carry out further research in this area of study. The present dissertation analyses the process of translation of a number of international news concerning the Catalan independence conflict performed by the Spanish press to generate news articles that compile information fragments from different journalistic sources. The analysis comprises a comparative study of the selection of the information that will be translated, as well as an examination of the most prominent translation techniques used to elaborate the target reports, with the aim of evaluating whether the Spanish reports portray international points of view or adapts their content to the newspapers' editorial line through a process of tribalisation.</dc:description>
