    <dc:description>This dissertation seeks to demonstrate that the introduction of a literary project focused on the short story genre written by women writers which have as central theme the problem of gender violence can help students in the Bachillerato stage to develop their key competences as well as their communicative competences, as they work on curricular themes and values such as gender violence and equality. I also intend to prove that a project as the one hereby proposed can increase students’s interest in literature and develop their skills for collaborative work. This study has been theoretically based on Second Language Acquisition (SLA) Communicative Language Teaching (CLLT), Project-Based Language Learning (PBLL), and more specifically, on the use of Literature in the EFL classroom and Feminist Pedagogy with a focus on Secondary Education. This theoretical basis, as well as the curricula Spanish framework is at the core of a project designed to be implemented with Bachillerato students with the objective of using literature as a vehicle to educate against gender violence. This dissertation demonstrates that the EFL classroom is an adequate scenario for this aim because the communicative nature of the subject allows for development both of students communicative competence and critical thinking and values. The results obtained from the partial implementation of this project with real students reveals that the project proposed could be successfully implemented within the actual curriculum.Keywords: PBLL, literature, gender violence, Feminist Pedagogy&lt;br /&gt;</dc:description>
