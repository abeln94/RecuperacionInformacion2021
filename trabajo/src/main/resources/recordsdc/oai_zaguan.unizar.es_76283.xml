    <dc:description>In the 21st century, characterised by the rise of globalisation, the emergence of the information society and the increase in immigration, an overwhelming proportion of the world’s population wishes to acquire a good command of English that enables them to fully participate in society. The main aim of this dissertation is to enhance the benefits of using literary resources in the EFL secondary classroom for developing students’ linguistic-communicative competence and cultural competence as well as ethical and humanitarian values. After providing a theoretical and curricular framework, a study has been developed with a view to obtaining a detailed description of secondary education teachers’ employment of literary resources when teaching EFL in Aragón and designing a teaching proposal that aimed to demonstrate that literary resources could be used for developing students’ communicative competence. As two sessions could be delivered, the feedback received from students has been also analysed in order to compare their attitude towards literature and its use in the EFL classroom before and after the implementation.</dc:description>
