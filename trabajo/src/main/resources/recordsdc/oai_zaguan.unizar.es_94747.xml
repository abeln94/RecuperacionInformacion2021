    <dc:description>The aim of this dissertation is to analyse how Emily Brontë’s novel, Wuthering Heights (1847), displays the coercive social and legal conditions of women within Victorian society, in a background of a rising concern about marital life and domestic abuse. Wuthering Heights depicts women’s reality within their marriage, a submissive and relegated position that frequently led to wife battery. For this purpose, this essay is divided into three parts: the first one presents The Heights as a place of violence in which women are trapped by Heathcliff. The second part focuses on the domestic violence exerted by Heathcliff on his wife, Isabella Linton, and Cathy Linton, and how his behaviour changes from victim to victimiser, reproducing brutality as a learnt behaviour and consequently bolstering a cycle of violence in order to achieve his personal interests. Finally, the third part analyses how Isabella and Cathy Linton’s married encounters of domestic violence influence their own personality, concentrating on Isabella’s account that brings light to this troublesome issue. This part focuses on their similar experiences, comparing women to animals but also on their different endings, Isabella’s death and Cathy’s happy closure, to conclude that violence surrounds both of them, and that only through courage and temperance they will be able to escape that torture cycle. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</dc:description>
