    <dc:description>High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) imaging and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), when conducted in a TEM, are very powerful techniques for studying the structure and composition of nanomaterials at the local scale. Their impact and richness can even been improved if, in parallel, the response of the nanomaterials to an external stimuli is investigated (in situ conditions). During this Final Master Project, these techniques, under in situ conditions, have been developed to investigate two different kind of carbon-based nanomaterials: endohedral functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes (SW-CNTs) with fullerenes (peapods) and graphene oxide (GO). &lt;br /&gt;Electron irradiation in-situ TEM experiments have been carried out on these peapods systems. The evolution of this carbon hybrid nanostructure under electron irradiation has been studied. Experimental results showed that, through the energy applied by electronic irradiation, vacancies were formed in the wall of the nanotube resulting in the reaction with the fullerene and finally forming a nanobud (combination of a SWNT and spherical fullerene).&lt;br /&gt;The second system that we have investigated was graphene oxide. We have studied the electrical characteristics and the evolution of the structure and composition of graphene oxide via in situ electrical TEM measurements. To prepare the sample, a dual beam microscope has been employed to deposit the GO flake on a TEM nano-chip. Then, we proceeded with the application of in situ electrical measurements to observe the changes in the GO by taking low loss and core loss EEL spectra. These spectra allow us to study the composition, thickness and sp2 / sp3 of the sample. We have measured the electrical conductivity of GO and the relationship with the reduction and graphizitation of a GO flake.&lt;br /&gt;All these in situ TEM works have provided important inputs for the knowledge of these particular carbon nanostructures, their transformation and their properties. Some of these results will have a clear impact on the application of these nanomaterials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</dc:description>
