    <dc:description>The Iberian pig is a racial entity native to the Iberian Peninsula with great adipogenic capacity that involves an extremely good meat quality. Nevertheless, the Iberian pig breed is composed by several differentiate strains involving a very large genetic diversity. The genomic differentiation between strains can be due to genetic drift or because of selection and adaptation processes that may have left relevant signals within the genomic structure of the populations.  We have used the genotypes from 349 individuals from pure and crossbred populations with the Illumina porcine SNP60 BeadChip provided by the IBEROMICS grant (CDTI-IDI-20170304 and CICYT-CGL-2016-80155). The porcine SNP60 BeadChip included around 55,000 SNP markers evenly spaced within the porcine genome. With this information, three alternative procedures for the detection of signatures of selection were applied. The first (FST) was based on the differentiation between populations, the second (ROH) on the reduction of local variation and the third (nSL) on the extension of the linkage disequilibrium. Later on, the genes present within the genomic regions associated with signatures of selection were identified using a genomic browser (www.ensembl.org).  Finally, gene enrichment procedures were used to identify the metabolic pathways associated with selection or differentiation between the Iberian strains.   The metabolic pathways identified with each procedure were different as they were associated with selection events at different evolutionary times. The older ones were identified with the ROH method and they corresponded to aminoacid transportation, immune response, neurotransmission, cellular structure process or very primary biological processes. The FST procedure identified pathways associated with morphological development, lipid metabolism, immune response and Na-K equilibrium. Finally, the most recent signals were hormonal and metabolic regulation, cell proliferation and cellular response as they were identified by the nSL procedure. In addition, the genes located in the selected genomic regions were also discussed.</dc:description>
